    "lore": "Through the long winter of '18 and the mania that followed, the mercenaries at Raid Guild have gathered to share stories of battle, cleaning the Blood of Moloch from their armor and sharpening their swords. Inspired by the tirelessness of fellow Raid Guild members, the noble Sasquatch, a cleric and master of potions, concocted a fermented beverage to quench the thirsts for our ongoing battle with Moloch. The recipe and the brewing of this dark nectar has resulted in what will forever be known as Blood Of Moloch."
